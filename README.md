# lmms-collab
Trying to create a musical collaboration in a way nobody did before.

A few important things if you want to contribute:
- Always make sure to have the latest version of the project before you do anything. I try to merge open PRs asap.
- Before making changes to a project, please copy the original one into the archive folder with a date-code, so we can revisit the versions later. Example: noclue_20-07-25.mmp


When working on a song, please follow these guidelines:
- Only use instruments/effects that are included in LMMS 1.2.2 stable. No VST or anything like that.
- You can use factory samples as long as their location/filename is not changed. But no external samples or soundfonts.
- Please don't use global automations or any black-magic. It's better for everyone.

Let's make music!
